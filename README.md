# CSS Basic Layout and Styling Project

This project is part of the **ALX Frontend** curriculum. The goal is to apply fundamental CSS concepts, including Flexbox layout and basic styling.

---

## âœ… Tasks Completed

### 1. Layout Structure Using Flexbox

- Used `<body>` and `<main>` as Flexbox containers.
- Applied the following rules in `styles.css`:
  - `display: flex` on `<body>` and `<main>`.
  - `flex-direction: column` on `<body>` to stack `<header>`, `<main>`, and `<footer>`.
  - `flex-direction: row` on `<main>` to align `<article>` and `<aside>` side-by-side.
  - `flex: auto` on `<main>` to allow it to grow and shrink as needed.
  - `flex: 2` on `<article>` and `flex: 1` on `<aside>` to control width ratio (2:1).
  - `overflow-y: auto` on both `<article>` and `<aside>` to enable scrolling.

---

### 2. Styling and Customization

- Created and edited `styles.css` to include custom non-positioning styles such as:
  - Backgrounds
  - Colors
  - Borders
- Applied custom styles specifically within the `<article>` tag as permitted.

---

### 3. Logo Addition

- Added a Unicode character as a **logo** to the top-left of the page.
  - Inserted it as the **first list item** in the `<header>`.
  - Used a character from [Unicode Symbol Table](https://symbl.cc/en/unicode-table/).
  - Applied the `class="logo"` to style it larger and distinct.

---

## ðŸš« Restrictions Followed

- Did **not** change the Flexbox layout logic.
- Did **not** use absolute or fixed positioning outside of the `<article>`.
- Focused only on customizing styles within the allowed scope.
